### My name is Dael Francillon and I'm a Computer Science major at Florida International University. 
### This will be my last year attending, so I am hoping to learn as much about coding, data structure, computer architecture, and flat out everything there is to know about computers.  If you need to reach me, my email is dfran155@fiu.edu. 
### BEFORE I GO, I WOULD LIKE TO SOLIDIFY THIS STATEMENT IN HISTORY. THE MIAMI HEAT WILL ABSOLUTELY CRUSH THE DENVER NUGGETS. HEAT IN 5.
